This is a simple Pong game.
This game is designed to play between two players using the keys 'W' and 'S' and 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys. The ball starts from center and goes in random direction.
Once the ball hits Paddle One, it bounces back to the Paddle Two's side. If it misses and goes out of the window, Player One scores and other way around for Player Two. 
I plan to work on how to make it Single Player game and against Computer, along with how to make the ball come from random direction rather than starting from center.
